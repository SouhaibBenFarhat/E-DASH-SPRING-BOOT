# E-DASH-SPRING-BOOT

### Description

E-Dash : E-Dash is the name of our project that I, and three of my colleagues, realized as part of our ESPRIT training. The project boils down to automating the process of mixing aromas to obtain an "E-Juice" for electronic cigarettes smokers. To do this, the project was divided into three main parts.

- Web part : Realize with Spring to offer a back office for our project and to generate the necessary services for our mobile application.
